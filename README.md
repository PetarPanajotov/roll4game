# Roll4Next 🎲

**Stop scrolling. Start rolling.**

Roll4Next is a discovery platform designed to help you decide **what’s next**—whether that’s a video game, TV show, film, or board game. In an era of infinite choice and "scroll paralysis," Roll4Next focuses on **choice reduction**, giving you a curated starting point instead of an endless list.

🚀 **Live Deployment:** [https://roll4game.vercel.app/](https://roll4game.vercel.app/)

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Domain Migration Notice:** We are currently rebranding from **Roll4Game** to **Roll4Next**. The URL above is currently active, but it will be migrating to a new **roll4next** domain shortly to align with our expanded scope.

## 🎯 The Mission

Modern entertainment platforms provide too many options, leading to decision fatigue. Roll4Next restores the excitement of discovery by making each "roll" feel intentional.

Instead of browsing through algorithms designed to keep you scrolling, you roll the dice—and something new finds you.
